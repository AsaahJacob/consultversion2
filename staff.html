        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Founder & Lead Consultant</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Ms. Rasheena Reid is a uniquely qualified professional whose career spans
        law, diplomacy, education, and international development. A tax attorney
        by training, a former U.S. diplomat, and an experienced educator,
        Rasheena brings a multidisciplinary and global perspective to her
        consultancy services.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Over the course of a distinguished 15-year diplomatic career, Rasheena
        served in U.S. Embassies around the world, where she advised senior U.S.
        and foreign government officials on complex foreign policy matters and
        spearheaded development initiatives aimed at fostering sustainable
        growth in emerging countries. Her work with the U.S. Agency for
        International Development (USAID) took her to Peru, Afghanistan, the
        Dominican Republic, Liberia, and Ghana—where she designed and managed
        programs in economic development, education, governance, and
        humanitarian aid.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Rasheena’s academic credentials are equally impressive. She holds a
        Bachelor of Arts from Yale University, a Juris Doctor and Master’s in
        Education from the University of Pennsylvania, and an LL.M. in Taxation
        from Georgetown Law. This robust educational foundation equips her with
        a deep understanding of U.S. and international tax law, educational
        policy, and legal frameworks affecting global development.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In addition to her legal and diplomatic accomplishments, Rasheena is a
        dedicated educator. She began her career as a Teach For America corps
        member, teaching high school Spanish, and has continued to share her
        knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese, and mathematics in both classroom and
        tutoring settings. Fluent in both Spanish and Portuguese, she has taught
        and worked extensively in Brazil, combining her linguistic skills with
        legal and educational expertise.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Rasheena Reid’s rare blend of legal acumen, diplomatic experience, and
        teaching excellence makes her an exceptional consultant in tax law,
        international development, humanitarian work, and multilingual
        education.
