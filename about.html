    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Rasheena Reid is a uniquely qualified professional whose career spans law, diplomacy, education, and international development. A tax attorney by training, a former U.S. diplomat, and an experienced educator, Rasheena brings a multidisciplinary and global perspective to her consultancy services.

She began her career as a Teach For America corps member, teaching high school Spanish, and has continued to share her knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese, and mathematics in both classroom and tutoring settings. Fluent in both Spanish and Portuguese, she has taught and worked extensively in Brazil, combining her linguistic skills with legal and educational expertise.
